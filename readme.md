# Drag and drop JPG to PNG converter

---

- [ ] Fix not working on drag and drop.
  - idea is to get original file name from external script and upload it then process it with express
  - or set the imgFile input value, when it is calling onDrop event then get that value in express and process it
    - also myb pass isDropDown variable to trigger different aproach in express
    - pass isDragable with data-dragable=true. Html data atribute in file form
- [ ] Add dropdown option for different file types
